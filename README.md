**Tree Chopper** is a simple mod, which allows you to chop down the whole tree. The only thing you need to do is break the bottom block with an axe. Stop breaking the tree block by block! Just destroy the bottom the of the trunk and the whole tree will break.

*   Tree Chopper can be used as server-side mod, but client-side is recommended (because of non-synchronous visual breaking)
*   Can be deactivated by holding SHIFT.
*   Config with settings and list of allowed axes and types of wood.
*   Option to reverse function (chopping with SHIFT)

#### Usage
Type in-game command "/tch help" for more info.

#### Add new wood or axe
There should be no need to add a supported wood or axe type. If another mod has an axe, as long as it implements `AxeItem` it is supported.

The same goes for wood. As long as the tree uses `BlockTags.LOGS` then it is supported.
